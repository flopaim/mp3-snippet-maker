How to use it
You need Python 3 (I use 3.9) and you need to install the following packages via pip:

pydub
numpy

1. download main.py and put it into a folder
2. In the folder you created, create a folder called 'in' and a folder called 'out'.
3. Place your tag (mp3 format) in the first folder
4. Download ffmpeg, ffplay, and ffprobe and put them into the first folder. You can get it here (full build).
5. Place songs you want to make snippets of into the 'in' folder
6. Run the script. Snippets will be made and placed into the out folder

enjoy
